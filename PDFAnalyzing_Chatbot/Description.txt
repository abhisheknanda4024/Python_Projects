Here's a suggested description for your PDF analyzing chatbot project:
PDF Analyzer Chatbot
This project is a web application that allows users to upload a PDF document and 
then ask questions about the content of that PDF. 
The key features of this project include:

PDF File Upload: Users can upload a PDF file to the web application using a simple file upload button.

PDF Content Scanning: Once the PDF file is uploaded, the application scans and processes the 
entire document to extract its content and prepare it for the question-answering functionality.

Searchable Question Input: After the PDF is uploaded, a search bar appears where users can type in their questions about the PDF content.

Localized Answers: The application uses natural language processing to analyze the user's question 
and then provide an approximate answer based solely on the information contained within the uploaded PDF file, without searching the internet.

This project is designed to be a useful tool for students, researchers, or anyone who needs to quickly find information within a PDF document.
By leveraging the power of AI and natural language processing, the PDF Analyzer Chatbot can save users time and effort in extracting relevant details from lengthy PDF files.
